## ChatRoom

### Motivation

Having finished my course at Makers Academy, I wanted to use some of the technology from my final project for a pet project: a chatroom.

Essentially my plan is to build a clone of the online version of Slack.

### Tech Stack

Node, Express

Zombie, Mocha and Chai for testing and nyc/istanbul for coverage

I shall use websockets to allow for constant updating of the page to accommodate instant updates on incoming messages.

### In order to run program locally

In terminal run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

and visit **localhost:3000**
